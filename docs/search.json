    "text": "S&P500 5 ML Quant Strategy\nThis is a quantitative stock selection strategy. It uses machine learning (ML) models to rank stocks in the S&P500 and selects the highest ranking ones.\nThis strategy has been live since November 26 and this chart shows the performance and some basic statistics. In the chart below the benchmark is the S&P500.\n\n\nThese are the holdings as of 12/28/2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nWeight\nReturn %\nReturn\nRank\nShares\nAvg Share Cost*\nCurrent Price\nValue\nDays Held\nSector\n\n\n\n\n0\nFTNT\n19.43%\n0.59%\n1182.84\n98.2\n2480.0\n81.08\n81.56\n202268.80\n28\nTechnology\n\n\n1\nGRMN\n20.24%\n5.17%\n10347.59\n99.8\n1025.0\n195.41\n205.51\n210647.75\n28\nTechnology\n\n\n2\nMETA\n20.07%\n2.76%\n5601.93\n98.8\n315.0\n645.51\n663.29\n208936.35\n28\nTechnology\n\n\n3\nNVDA\n20.28%\n7.26%\n14284.60\n99.2\n1108.0\n177.64\n190.53\n211107.24\n28\nTechnology\n\n\n4\nTTWO\n20.17%\n4.17%\n8399.97\n99.6\n820.0\n245.85\n256.09\n209993.80\n28\nTechnology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are different components to a quantitative stock selection strategy.\n\nStock Universe\nThe Universe is the group of stocks used in the strategy. This one uses only stocks within the S&P500 index.\n\n\nRanking System\nThe Ranking System ranks all the stocks in the Universe from best to worst. This one uses a ML model to do the ranking. The model architecture used is LightGBM which is a kind of boosted regression tree model. It is trained on about 70 different features over 15 years of data. The feature set includes a wide variety of data including value, growth, quality, momentum and sentiment. I will write more about this in a different post.\n\n\nBuy/Sell Strategy\nInitially, the strategy selects the top 5 ranked stocks from the S&P500. The portfolio is rebalanced once a week. If any stocks ranking falls out of the top 8% then it is sold and replaced by the highest ranked stock not currently in the portfolio."
