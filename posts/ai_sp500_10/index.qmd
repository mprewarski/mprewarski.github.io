# S&P500 10 ML Quant Strategy

This strategy uses the same Machine Learning ranking system as in the previous post. The difference is this
one selects 10 stocks and has slightly different sell rules that attempt to minimize turnover for taxable accounts.

I expect this one to beat the S&P500 benchmark over time but probably not do as well as the strategy with the top 5 stocks.
In evaluation of the model and backtesting of the strategy, selecting the top 5 stocks performed better.

These are the holdings as of 01/08/2026.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

holdings = pd.read_csv("holdings.csv")
holdings.columns = holdings.columns.str.strip()
holdings = holdings.loc[:, ~holdings.columns.str.contains("^Unnamed")]
holdings
```
