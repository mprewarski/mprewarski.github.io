## S&P500 5 ML Quant Strategy

I wanted to share what I've been working on in case any friends might find this useful or interesting.
This is a quantitative stock selection strategy. It uses machine learning (ML) models to rank stocks
in the S&P500 and selects the highest ranking ones.

This strategy has been live since November 26 and this chart shows the performance and some basic statistics.

These are the holdings as of today.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

holdings = pd.read_csv("holdings.csv")
holdings.columns = holdings.columns.str.strip()
holdings = holdings.loc[:, ~holdings.columns.str.contains("^Unnamed")]
holdings
```
